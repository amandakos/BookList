# BookList
Using Python, an interactive book list is created.
First, a list is created and populated with an initial list of books.
Then functions are defined for listing the books, adding books, removing books, and marking a book read.
Next, a message is created to help the user know the options available.
Then a while loop is created with elif conditions for changes to the list.
